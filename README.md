# Predicting range of EVs using Linear Regression

Predicting the range of electric vehicles (EVs) using linear regression can be a useful approach to estimate how far an EV can travel on a single charge based on certain input variables. In this context, the range of an EV refers to the distance it can travel before needing to be recharged.
